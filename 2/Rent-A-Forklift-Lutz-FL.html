<p>Forklift types vary in several aspects, from their fuel type and tire composition to their lift capacity and height.

<h2>How To Ensure Forklift Safety in Lutz </h2>
<p>ACT offers very flexible forklift rental time frames, as well as other material handling equipment rental packages. In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144” you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>Many warehouses and similar operations only need specific equipment at certain times of the year. Our nationwide dealer network has a broad range of lift truck models available for immediate rental. Fewer Responsibilities: With the purchase of a service or maintenance plan, if anything does go wrong with the leased forklift, the dealer will take care of it.</p>
<p>A slight variation on the walkie rider pallet jack, the operator stands in the middle of a center-controlled rider pallet jack. Counterbalanced forklifts have been a source of storage and handling systems, where they perform loading, stacking, distribution and horizontal transport functions. Renting is ideal for short-term jobs or situations where equipment needs may change quickly.</p>
<h2>Reach Lift Truck Lutz</h2>

Raymond offers a full line of durable pallet trucks for sale and pallet jack rentals to meet your delivery, order picking, and horizontal transport needs. The maximum allowable load should be clearly marked on the nameplate of the forklift truck.</p>
