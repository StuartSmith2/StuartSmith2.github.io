A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>

<p>The U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) has guidelines in place to help forklift operators, pallet jack drivers, and other industrial powered truck workers be aware of their machine's ability to lift, maneuver, and store cargo. When it's done right, you can expect a lifted Jeep to have better pulling power, a greater capacity to off-road because of its increased clearance, and the ability to use a much larger set of off-road tires.</p>
<p>Being trained to operate a forklift with an internal combustion engine and pneumatic tires, also known as a Class 5, that is commonly used in General Industry, only allows one to operate that specific class of lift truck.

<p>If you have ever ridden in, or driven a lowered truck, you are well aware of that lifted Super Duty coming up from behind with the headlights shining clear above your cab and lighting up the night sky ahead of you, as if you had a roof-mounted lightbar attached to your road grater.
