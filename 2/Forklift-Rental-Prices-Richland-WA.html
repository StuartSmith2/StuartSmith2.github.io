<h2>Fork Truck Companies Richland</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>

Keep in mind that forklift rentals aren't the only warehouse equipment leases we'll do - floor cleaning equipment, personnel carriers, burden carriers and more are all available to rent out.
