We have grown from a primarily used forklift warehouse to a fully functioning forklift dealership. This is the leading cause of death involving lift trucks. When a traditional forklift isn't necessary but lifting product above a second-tier rack is, the Toyota Industrial Stacker is a cost-efficient, easy-to-use solution.</p>
