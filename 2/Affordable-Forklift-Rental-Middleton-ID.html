<p>By control, by type, by load capacity, by end use industry and by region, to offer insights on the global Pallet Trucks market. Rough terrain forklift operation requires the driver to be constantly aware of the ground surface conditions in the direction of movement, and requires focused attention at every phase of the task at hand. In such scenarios, Forklift Trucks play an important role in the food and beverage industry.</p>
