<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.).

The counterbalance forklift features two forks at the front and has the ability to drive up close to a load to pick it up and move it.
