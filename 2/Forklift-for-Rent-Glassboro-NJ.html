These types of forklifts are designed to run on a variety of fuel types, the most common being liquid propane and diesel.

You will also need to know what the required turning radius is, and also, the minimum aisle width the lift truck will be working in. This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>

There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
<p>Given their job description and different types of conditions to deal with, order pickers need to be OSHA compliant with their training.
