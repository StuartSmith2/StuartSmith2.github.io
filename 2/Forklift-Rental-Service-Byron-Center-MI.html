The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>
<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>
