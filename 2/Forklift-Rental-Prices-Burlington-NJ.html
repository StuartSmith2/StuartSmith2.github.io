<h2>Be Aware When Operating a Fork Lift Truck in Burlington </h2>
<p>Speak to our representatives about finding the right lift truck and rental plan for your application. The most important part of choosing shocks for a lifted truck (besides knowing your truck's year, make, and model) is making sure you know the correct lift height.
