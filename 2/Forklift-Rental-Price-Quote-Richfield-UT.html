<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck in standing is tilted to the slope specified in Graph E. Our company, over the years, with its vast experience in this domain offers wide range of Heavy Duty Pallet Truck for various industrial uses.</p>
<h2>Used Pallet Jack Richfield</h2>

China is expected to create attractive opportunities for the Pallet Trucks manufacturers followed by countries located in the South East Asia & Pacific and India.</p>
