<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>At Eagle Forklift Sales & Service, we understand that loyalty needs to be earned through trust, value, consistency, service, and more. All of the key components of the forklift including wheels, counterweight and mast are attached to the truck frame. Most forklift rentals give general training for handling the rented equipment.
