<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher. OSHA requires any forklift operators to be trained and certified to operate the powered industrial truck in the workplace and that operator's performance be evaluated on the provisions 1910.178 (I)(3) every three years. This will help determine the capacity of the forklift you need to rent.</p>

<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>

This is among a very good quality pallet truck with great durability and support. Call to discuss load types and warehouse limitations for your safety and accuracy. The rough-terrain or straight-mast forklift has become more of a niche machine, rather than an ‘everybody-needs-one' machine,” says Charlie Detrich, U.S. sales & dealer development manager for Liftking.</p>
<p>3-wheel forklifts are typically more maneuverable than 4-wheel machines. Your crew can easily drive these machines through small openings and use them in tight workspaces. As a result, customers can get the best possible lift kit installation process. The Cat Lift Trucks Scholarship Program has awarded more than $130,000 in educational assistance to Houston-area students.</p>
<p>In addition to simply driving a fork lift, working as a fork lift operator requires the ability to properly lift, balance, and stack heavy loads that are ordinarily arranged on a wood pallet or a pallet made from other materials. They offer a streamlined credit approval process so you can rent forklifts (and other equipment, if needed) without paying the full price up front.</p>
