<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>

The mast shall be at full rearward tilt and the forks the elevated until the point of intersection of the two load-carrying surfaces of the forks is 12 inches from the floor.</p>

But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature.
