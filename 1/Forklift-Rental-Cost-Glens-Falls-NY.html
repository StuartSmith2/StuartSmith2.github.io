<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
<p>Linde is constantly developing its order pickers, aiming to make working conditions even safer and more ergonomic for operators, which is why, for example, the latest generation of order picking devices feature an even lower entry height. Infinitely variable lift and lower control provides smooth control for precise platform work.
