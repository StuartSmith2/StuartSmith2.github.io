<p>The operator does not need to pull the load and machine nor does the operator have to manually pump the handle to lift the load. With a complete range of rental plans to choose from, greater flexibility in handling operational peaks and troughs, and predictable costs, rentals can make both commercial and financial sense.

<p>A 4,000 lbs forklift with a 500 lbs clamp can only add 3,500 more lbs of items. The pallet jack is the little brother to the forklift Generally the heavier a pallet jack is, the more weight it can handle on its rated operating capacity. According to U.S. government statistics, forklift-related accidents account for nearly 20,000 injuries and nearly 100 fatalities per year.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height for the limit of travel speed, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph C about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
