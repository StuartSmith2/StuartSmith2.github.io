This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks.

Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
