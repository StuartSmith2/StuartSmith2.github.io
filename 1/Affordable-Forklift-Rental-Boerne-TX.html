<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory.

As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers.

The correct capacity will narrow your used forklift for sale search down to a couple of models. Smaller in size when compared to pneumatic tire forklift of equal capacity.
