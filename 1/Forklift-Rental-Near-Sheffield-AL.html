<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>
<p>They have small tires designed to run on paved surfaces and are usually powered by an internal combustion engine running on gasoline, diesel, or propane fuel. Lift Capacity: 16000 lbs. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full reaward tilt, whichever is less stable.
