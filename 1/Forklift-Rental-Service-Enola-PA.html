Achieving nearly 10% growth, Hangcha Group sold 82,350 units across all forklift classes, an increase of more than 23%, and good enough to climb from No. 12 in 2015 to No. 9.

Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
