<p>Double Reach Trucks are commonly used in factory, food processing and general warehousing industries. Trying to lift loads too heavy for your forklift creates a great risk of a tip-over accident, this can also risk damaging product and plant facilities. A double mast forklift has a second mast attached to the carriage of the first mast. There's no better way to move equipment and materials around a factory or work site than with a forklift.</p>
<p>As well as a number of different lift heights and capacity classes, our reach truck range also includes models for varying ground conditions. When you hire forklift trucks then they can reduce hard labor at your work site. Please wait while we load filters for all of our rental equipment. Innovative lift truck provides a range of high capacity lift options. Whether you are looking for a manual, semi-electric or fully electric pallet truck, you can find them all at TVH.</p>

The test load should be equivalent to an unrestrained, homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension, and should equal in weight to the rated capacity of the truck. Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>
