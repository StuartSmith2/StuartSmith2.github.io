For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
