<p>With high ground clearance and durable super-elastic wheels, these forklifts are ideal for working in indoor and outdoor environments.

<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,‚Äù are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>Hydraulic Pallet Truck is designed with polyurethane rollers that allow the machine to operate easily. The suspension lift kit, on the other hand, actually modifies the structure of the suspension so it sits higher off the ground, giving you significantly more ground clearance. If you've got one, you know washing a lifted truck can be tricky. Don't wait - our lifted trucks have a high interest and they won't last long.</p>
