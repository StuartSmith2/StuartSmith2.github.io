We are a well-known manufacturer, exporter, wholesaler, distributor and supplier of Full Electric Pallet Truck, which is an efficient performing product of our company. A significant portion of my business deals with forklift operator training (or more precisely, powered industrial truck operator training).</p>

<p>The 30 Wastemaster counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks. Battery electric forklifts, powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks.</p>
