Conform with manufacturers requirements as per the operators handbook, other types of information source and relevant regulations and legislation.</p>

A parking brake (or mechanism) shall be provided and capable of holding the truck on the maximum grade which the truck can negotiate with rated capacity load, or on a 15 percent grade, whichever is the lesser.
