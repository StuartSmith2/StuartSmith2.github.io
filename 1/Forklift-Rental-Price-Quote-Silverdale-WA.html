<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Available for a majority of popular trucks including the 1500 Silverado and the Ram 2500, Fabtech makes sure your truck gets lifted the right way without taking any shortcuts. With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling.</p>
<p>Unlike other online shops, our customer support representatives are actual mechanics who are seasoned in fitting, installing, and maintaining truck and SUV air suspension. For instance, if a heavy load brings the center of gravity all the way to the front axle — the theoretical edge of the stability triangle — sudden braking could shift the load forward and out of the triangle altogether.</p>
