<p>The load of the forks must be balanced by the weight of the lift truck in order for this principle to work. These are Class 5 forklifts. A reach fork truck is primarily an indoor forklift most useful for reaching high racks. It can be used in all types of workplaces where efficient material handling is desired. If you are looking for a second hand forklift for sale, then this is the ideal site to help you.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
