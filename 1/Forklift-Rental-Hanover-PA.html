STILL offers rental trucks for flexible rental periods. Allowing operators to tow palletised or non-palletised loads, our towing tractors are suitable for indoor and outdoor applications, including production lines, cross-dock logistics, airports, railway stations and ports.</p>
<p>Also, the Entry Bar Safety Switch at the compartment opening on Crown's stand-up and counterbalance reach trucks slows the truck to a stop and sounds an alarm if operators attempt to drive the truck with part of their foot resting on the ledge. This makes the global pallet truck market fragmented in nature. A pallet jack scale or a pallet truck scale can typically lift 120 mm.</p>
<p>This is the reason why Linde reach trucks are equipped with such features as adjustable steering. These are just the most common types of forklift trucks. They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.

<p>Electric forklifts don't generate polluting emissions, and although they are usually the most expensive to buy, they are the cheapest in terms of operating costs. All operators are required to wear a harness while operating any order picker at any height. Heli is China's number one manufacturer of forklifts and 6th largest in the world.

However, statistics show that companies that own their fleets tend to keep their forklifts longer than financially makes sense.</p>
