Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

The type of load also matters as there are specific forklift attachments that can enhance a standard forklift and help you move the load more efficiently.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg).

The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
