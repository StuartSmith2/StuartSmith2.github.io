We take care of the maintenance of all of our rental forklifts for you. With their stronger frames, they can lift heavier loads higher than forklifts that operate in warehouses, for example.

The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
