<p>Much more significant than any of the other forklift classes, class 7s are almost exclusively used outdoors to carry the most substantial materials to the loading docks or storage. At the same time, reach trucks offer very high acceleration as well as impressive lift and reach speeds, which in turn ensures excellent throughput performance. There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>

<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface.
