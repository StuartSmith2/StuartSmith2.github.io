We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>

<h2>Pallet Lift Truck Sterling</h2>

Class V forklifts are rider fork trucks, with cabs and seated controls, internal combustion engines, and pneumatic tires. We sell, rent and support the full lines of Cat, Mitsubishi, Jungheinrich and Taylor Lift Trucks. If you're a more adventurous driver that likes to go off-road, a lifted truck is a great way to enable you to challenge yourself to take on more difficult terrain.</p>

<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking. They are smaller than most forklifts and so are able to manoeuvre in those hard-to-reach areas. Forget parking garages, and height clearance could become an issue in some drive thrus. With breakthrough lift heights, capacities, visibility and energy savings, the Crown family of reach trucks can help you move and store materials efficiently.</p>
<p>Sharing a chassis with the 7300 series "severe-service" truck, it comes from the factory with a permanent all-wheel drive train, heavy duty anti-lock air drum brakes, and either a 7.6L or 8.7L inline six cylinder turbo diesels. Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>
