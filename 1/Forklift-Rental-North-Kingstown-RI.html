<h3>Used Propane Forklift For Sale North Kingstown RI</h3>
<p>When it's time to choose a supplier for your forklift needs, it's important to know that they take your questions and concerns seriously. An alternative to class 3s, tuggers can pull large loads without requiring the equipment to lift it off the ground to do it. This class is used on high traffic sites such as airport landing strips and luggage collection as they are easier to maneuver than a full forklift.</p>
