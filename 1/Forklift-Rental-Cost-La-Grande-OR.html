For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>Parts & Service - Our forklift parts and service departments are ready at a moments notice and can repair any brand of equipment in your fleet. Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond certified technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility. When you need to move materials, shift supplies, or store objects on a job site, a rough terrain forklift can do the job.</p>

Extreme Weather: Since rough terrain forklifts come equipped with high-traction tires, they can tackle all kinds of weather conditions. The Apex features a 6 inch off road suspension, custom wheels, and all-terrain tires.</p>

<h3>4 Ton Forklift La Grande OR</h3>
<p>A warehouse, distribution center, or other workplace with narrow aisles is the ideal setting for a reach truck, also known as a reach forklift or narrow aisle forklift. Our clients can avail from us a qualitative range of Hydraulic Pallet Truck. Lifted cars can be dangerous, especially if you're driving behind them. Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision.</p>
<p>Seasonal: Many businesses are cyclical in nature, and to maximize your capital expenditures, renting an extra lift truck to help you through the surge of your seasonal business is the right decision. With so many options available to you, the best way to make sure you find lifted trucks that work for what you need is through a knowledgeable and experienced dealer that specializes in these kinds of vehicles.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>
